    This version is a MAJOR revision to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. The
    format of the Excel file that it produces has been updated from
    Excel 5 to Excel 97. This allows support for long, 32k character
    strings and Unicode.

    DUE TO THE MAJOR INTERNAL CHANGES IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU TEST
    THIS UPGRADE FULLY BEFORE DEPLOYING IT.

    Also note that this version can be 1.5 to 2 times slower than
    previous versions and the write_comment() method has been
    temporarily removed. These issues will be fixed in later releases.

    + Added support for strings up to 32767 character.

    + Added support for Unicode strings.

    + Added more examples: diag_border.pl, indent.pl,
      unicode.pl, unicode_japan.pl, unicode_list.pl

    + Changed the distro dir structure.

    - Temporarily removed write_comment() support since the Excel 5
      version isn't compatible with Excel 97+.
