Revision history for Perl module Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.

2.13 April 20 2005 - Minor

    ! Made it a fatal error to use a merged format in a non-
      merged cell (and vice-versa). This is a temporary measure
      to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot
      until the Format.pm code can be refactored.

    + Add 01_merge_formats.t test for above.

    + Added date_time tests.


2.12 March 22 2005 - Minor

    + Added further Unicode support. The following methods now
      handle uft8 in perl 5.8:
      add_worksheet()
      set_header()
      set_footer()
      set_font()
      set_num_format()

    + Added unicode_cyrillic.pl example.

    + Added 01_add_worksheet.t test.


2.11 September 30 2004 - Minor

    - Removed undocumented date_time handling from write() to
      avoid potential false matches.

    + Added add_write_handler() method to allow users to add
      their own data handlers to write().

    + Added 4 write_handler examples.


2.10 September 23 2004 - Major

    + Added chart support via external templates.
      Added Chart.pm and add_chart_ext() method to Workbook object.
      Added /charts directory with examples and documentation

    + Added write_date_time() worksheet method for writing dates
      and times in Excel date format.
      Added date_time.pl example.

    + Added automatic Unicode handling via utf8 in perl 5.8 and
      later. Thanks Mark Fowler.
      Added several unicode_*.pl examples in different encodings.
      Thanks to Sean Burke for the sample encodings.

    + Added write_to_scalar.pl example in order to answer frequently
      asked question about writing an Excel file to a scalar.


2.04 August 18 2004 - Minor

    ! Fixed handling of Euro symbol in num_format() strings.

    ! Renamed the Excel 5 style merge() format to the more correct
      center_across(). Updated examples accordingly.

      merged ranges.

    + Fixed handling of doubled double quotes in formula strings.
      Thanks to a tip from merlyn.

    + Fixed internal version numbers to keep CPAN.pm happy.
      Thanks to David Dyck.

    + Minor changes to demo.pl merge5.pl and the html docs.


2.01 May 27 2004 - Major

    This version is a MAJOR revision to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. The
    format of the Excel file that it produces has been updated from
    Excel 5 to Excel 97. This allows support for long, 32k character
    strings and Unicode.

    DUE TO THE MAJOR INTERNAL CHANGES IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU TEST
    THIS UPGRADE FULLY BEFORE DEPLOYING IT.

    Also note that this version can be 1.5 to 2 times slower than
    previous versions and the write_comment() method has been
    temporarily removed. These issues will be fixed in later releases.


    + Changed the default Excel format to Excel 97.

    + Added support for strings up to 32767 character.

    + Added support for Unicode strings.

    + Improved speed in relation to pre-release versions.
      However, it is still slower than the 1.xx versions.

    + Improved OpenOffice.org support.

    + Added more examples: diag_border.pl, indent.pl,
      unicode.pl, unicode_japan.pl, unicode_list.pl

    + Changed the distro dir structure.

    - Temporarily removed write_comment() support since the Excel 5
      version isn't compatible with Excel 97+.

      outline.pl example. Thanks to Franco Venturi.

      and add_format() for consistency with other method names.
      Older names are supported but deprecated.


0.40 December 21 2002 - Minor

    ! Fixed internal sheet indexing in formulas on some platforms.
      This caused multi-sheet workbooks with formulas to crash.

      multi-threaded environments.

      useful for people working with non ascii chars on the Macintosh.
      Thanks Jody Goldberg.

    ! Fixed the non-deletion of temporary files. Users of version

      what Excel expected to what everyone else expected. Setting the
